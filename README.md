# MLOps Practice Project

## Problem Statement 1: Setting Up a Version Control System (VCS)

This repository is a part of my MLOps practice exercises. The objective of this project is to manage a basic machine learning project using **Git** and **GitHub**, which includes setting up version control, uploading datasets, and committing changes.

### Tasks
- Version control setup.
- Upload a dataset.
- Collaborate and commit changes.

#### Sample Dataset
- Iris Dataset (used for training ML models).
- It consists of data related to the physical attributes of iris flowers, including:
    - Sepal length
    - Sepal width
    - Petal length
    - Petal width
    - Class of iris (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
